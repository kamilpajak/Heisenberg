    "root_cause": "The provided test report indicates that **all 8 tests were skipped** and none failed or passed. This typically occurs for one of three reasons:\n1. A **Global Setup or `beforeAll` hook failed** earlier in the execution (which often skips the individual tests but should report an error).\n2. The tests are explicitly marked with `test.skip()` or `test.fixme()` in the code.\n3. The test runner was executed with specific **filters** (e.g., `--grep`) that matched the file names but excluded the specific test cases.",

      "**Summary Section:** Shows `Total tests: 8`, `Skipped: 8`, `Failed: 0`.",
      "**Failed Tests Section:** Empty (No error messages or stack traces provided)."
    ],
    "suggested_fix": "1. **Check Console Output:** Look for errors appearing *before* the test summary. If a `beforeAll` hook fails, the error usually appears there, even if the individual tests are marked as skipped.\n2. **Verify Configuration:** Check `playwright.config.ts` for global skip logic or project dependencies.\n3. **Check Filters:** Ensure the test command didn't include a `--grep` or `-g` flag that filtered out all tests in the suite.\n4. **Resubmit:** If there was an error message that caused the skip, please provide the full console output including the error log.",
